# twitter-live-streaming

I think the best way to practice you skills and knowledge is by doing interesting and challenging exercises.

Here is a another project that I have decided to do is to build a code that will use twitter developer credentials to connect to twitter live streaming using keyword(s) and scrape that data and then store it into SQL database. The code takes out specific data that I think could be useful for data scientist to do train and gather text data to build model to do sentiment analysis or NLP projects.

It have invested only 60 minutes in writing up this code so it takes out the specific data. People who are more advanced on technical side can easily make database bigger and gather more data from tweets (geo locations, specific languages, user data where tweet was re-tweeted and etc.)

All packages that are required are also attached so you can easily create environment and install all packages needed.

Hope it will be useful for someone.

Person can pass in arguments such as list of keywords seperated by pipe delimiter and time for how long user wants to scrape the data (in seconds)
